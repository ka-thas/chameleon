🔁 How to play

Go around once. Each player says one word related to the secret word.

Be subtle. Too obvious = suspicious.

Discuss briefly.

Vote on who you think is the Chameleon.

🗳️ Scoring

Chameleon caught?

They get one last chance to guess the secret word.

Correct → Chameleon wins

Wrong → Others win

Wrong vote? Chameleon wins immediately

💡 Tips

Don’t be too specific.

As Chameleon: stay vague but relevant
